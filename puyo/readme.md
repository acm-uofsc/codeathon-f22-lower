# Puyo Puzzle

Puyo Puyo is a puzzle game where colored blobs called 'Puyos' are dropped from the top of the screen and when four of a kind or more connect you can cast a spell to make them vanish and power up!

This time around we're in space, so there is no gravity. Just give a sorted list of all the Puyo's you can pop sorting by row and then column to cast your attack. The rows are counted up from the top to the bottom, and the columns are counted from the left to the right, just like a matrix! Solution coordinates should be zero-indexed.

There are 7 colors of puyo possible.

M is the number of rows.
N is the number of columns.

12 <= M <= 2^6
6 <= N <= 2^5
