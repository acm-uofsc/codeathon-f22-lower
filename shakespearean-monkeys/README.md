# Shakespearean Monkeys

## Problem Statement

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a
typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any
given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. We will supply
the monkeys, but we need you to help us figure out when they have written
something good!

My favorite play by Shakespeare is *Romeo and Juliet*, so I want to be alerted
every time a monkey types the word 'Romeo'. I'll give you the text they write,
and I want you to tell me how many times 'Romeo' shows up.

## Input Format

The first line contains *x* and *y*, the number of lines in the paragraph we need you
to check and the number of characters in each line, respectively. *n* lines follow.

## Constraints

idk yet

## Output Format

Output the number of times the word 'Romeo' occurs in  the text.
